    <h2>Why am I taking this course?</h2>
  <p>I am interested in learning about coding and how to build a website. I am planning on going into Investment Banking, so I want to set myself apart from the crowd by being able to code a website for potential clients to look at portfolios or companies.

        <h3>Goals in the course?</h3>
        <p>I hope to create a website for Davidson students to access information about Investment Banking and Finance, so they can navigate the interview process easier.</p>

        <h4>Learn Computing Classes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I learned how to organize the files in my computer by correctly naming them and seperating them into folders that were relevant to the information inside of them. Additionally, I was able to begin understanding Git and the coding jargin in general. My favorite part about completing these informative activities was being able to watch my code come to life on the screen.</li>

      <h5>3 web based projects</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How bad is your Spotify?</a></li>
        <p>
        I thought this project was cool because it went through most of my Spotify songs and was able to see what I listened to the most. Interesting enough, it ranked me 25/100 because I was too basic. I would love to know what type of songs it was comparing mine to, to get the score.
        </p>
        <li><a href="http://endless.horse">Endless Horse</a></li>
        <p>I am a horse girl, so I just had to pick the project with the horse in the title. I like this project because the horses legs go on forever and ever.</p>
        <li><a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">This person does not exsist</a></li>
        <p>I like this project because I actually have seen it on tiktok. Additionally the person looks real but is not. I think that this could change the way movies are potentially made.</p>
      </ol>

  <!--I really enjoyed the process. The hardest part of the project was learning the language itself, but I was able to catch on super quick-->
